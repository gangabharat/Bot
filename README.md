# Bot

A bot command line tool is a program that allows users to interact with a bot through a command line interface (CLI). Users can input commands or queries directly into the command line, and the tool processes these inputs and provides corresponding responses or actions from the bot.

Typically, such tools are used for tasks like managing bots, sending commands to bots, retrieving information from bots, or automating certain actions performed by the bot.

The functionality of a bot command line tool can vary depending on the specific bot it is designed to interact with and the features it supports. Some common functionalities include sending messages, retrieving data, managing settings, and executing scripts or commands on the bot's platform.

Users can interact with the bot command line tool by typing commands or queries into the command line interface, and the tool interprets these inputs and communicates with the bot accordingly. This can be particularly useful for users who prefer text-based interfaces or need to perform tasks programmatically.
